        <h1>CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Are there any statistics on the percentage of UC Davis students that have their own cars?</li>
            <li>Would it be possible to send out a school-wide survey that asks how often students travel out of town?</li>
            <li>The UC Davis ridesharing Facebook page has 17k+ members, would the school be interested in implementing an app for those people?</li>
            <li>Are there any alternate features that you think would pair well with a ridesharing app?</li>
            <li>Could we implement a rewards system for students that use the app to help the environment?</li>
        </ol>
