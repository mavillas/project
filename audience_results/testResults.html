        <h1>USER TESTING RESULTS</h1>
        <p>Getting real feedback from people that were in my target audience was a great experience. I was able to get good suggestions on both design and content due to the background of both users. Some of the issues we discussed after their walkthrough of the app were things like color changes, separating driver and rider functions into different navigation tabs, and whether or not a built in messaging feature was needed. </p>

        <p>It was great to hear that both users would use the app if it were real, and that they'd recommend it to friends over the ridesharing Facebook page as well. Both users agreed that the built in messaging platform would be a huge plus for ease-of-use instead of having to copy contact information into another messaging app. Some of the changes that I'd make after talking with users would be experimenting more with color, adding some imagery for a "favorite destinations" feature, and actually incorporating the "driver/rider preferences" page.</p>
